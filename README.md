# Cewlrency, a currency converter built in Android
_[Built on RxJava, fueled by awesomness and ðŸ¤“-iness]_  

__This is a rewrite of my other currency app [HERE](https://github.com/paramsen/currency-android-vanilla "HERE")__

## Features
* Cool concurrency fueled by Rx. The kind that you just can't build with AsyncTasks, the kind without callback hell. Yup.
* Custom views and aggressive encapsulation. React -like architecture with View components.
* Architecture loosely based on Fowlers Uncle Bobs Clean Architecture.
* Functional approach to the problems of asynchronisity in Android. Not keen on the functional paradigm? Just take a look at the "CurrencyActivity" and let your heart speak for you. You might be familiar with the code from your backend systems, or even you React frontend. Well this is native Android, and for the first time, it rocks. It's fun to work with. No more horrific all knowing monolithic Android Activities. ðŸ¤“
* Vanilla Android version without 3rd party libs of this project; https://github.com/paramsen/currency-android-vanilla [Yes, you will find AsyncTasks in there you HR person from a larger agency]

## Architectural info
Inspired by DDD, Fowler and React.
* More info to come

## Look at
* Developing this so wait
